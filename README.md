### Agreements 

Cards:
* Please put cellphones on silent, but feel free to leave the room if you need to take a call
* Take Care: Take care of your own needs. You don’t need to ask permission to go to the bathroom, or get coffee.
* Cellphones: Keep your phones on silent please. If you need to take a call, just leave the room. We’d rather you were paying attention than worrying because your boss/wife/child is calling.
* Right to Pass: You have the right to pass in any activity or exercise we do. Just sit to the side and observe.
* Timeboxing: We give a specific end time for each break. We will start at that time whether you are back or not. It’s up to you to choose to be on time or not.

Agenda:
* breaks, lunch

### Form Groups

##	Goals of software testing

From https://leanpub.com/AgileTesting/read

Traditionally people think that the goal of testing is to find bugs. In fact some organisations even measure tester productivity based on the number of bugs they find (or don’t find). Once again this mindset is limiting, and helps reinforce the idea that testing is something that happens at the end.

Explain that anyone who wrote down a number other than 5 created a bug. Ask if they could think of any way that they could have prevented that bug. Hopefully someone will realise that they could have asked you what you mean by a point before writing down their answer. If no one mentions this, you can. Explain that this works exactly the same way in software. Often people make assumptions about requirements and implement those assumptions before clarifying them. The assumptions are only clarified once the software is tested, and the bug is then found. Imagine how much more productive it would be to have a short conversation to clarify assumptions before anyone wrote a single line of code.

## 7 Testing Principles

* Testing shows the presence of defects, not the absence
* Exhaustive testing is impossible
* Early Testing
* Defect Clustering and Pareto Principle
* Pesticide Paradox
* Testing is context dependent
* Absence of error fallacy

## Non-functional tests

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FURPS
* CUPRIMDSO (Capability, Usability, Performance, Reliability, Installability, Maintainability, Documentation, Servicability and Overall) Satisfaction levels.

## Energizers

* List the defects/enhancements in the room you are in right now. 
* Hold a pen. Identify the types of testing you would perform on it to make sure that it is of the highest quality. There is a simple program with the following items:
 * Input Box A
 * Input Box B
 * Add button
 * Result Text Box [=A+B]
 Identify all the test cases for the program. [Example: press the Add button without entering anything in Input Box A and B]
