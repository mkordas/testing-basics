##	Goals of software testing

From https://leanpub.com/AgileTesting/read

Traditionally people think that the goal of testing is to find bugs. In fact some organisations even measure tester productivity based on the number of bugs they find (or donâ€™t find). Once again this mindset is limiting, and helps reinforce the idea that testing is something that happens at the end.

Explain that anyone who wrote down a number other than 5 created a bug. Ask if they could think of any way that they could have prevented that bug. Hopefully someone will realise that they could have asked you what you mean by a point before writing down their answer. If no one mentions this, you can. Explain that this works exactly the same way in software. Often people make assumptions about requirements and implement those assumptions before clarifying them. The assumptions are only clarified once the software is tested, and the bug is then found. Imagine how much more productive it would be to have a short conversation to clarify assumptions before anyone wrote a single line of code.
